# Movieland

## Code Review and Refactoring

The original version of this project underwent a code review, which can be found in this [Pull Request](https://github.com/rpabon/movieland/pull/2).

**Note:** The master branch has been refactored and improved to include:

- Fixed features and code refactored following clean code practices
- Vite for faster build times and improved development experience
- TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer productivity
- CSS Modules for better CSS encapsulation and maintainability

These changes have significantly improved the project structure and development workflow.
